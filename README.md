## 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

Hey! I'm a teenager deeply curious about the digital world — especially how it can be protected, broken, and understood.

I’m currently studying cybersecurity, learning red teaming, and practicing skills like:

- Ethical hacking & penetration testing
- Linux (Kali, Whonix, and more)
- Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit
- TryHackMe, HackTheBox labs, and CTFs

I'm not a full-time coder — I’m just learning the **right amount of programming** needed for hacking. And I believe **persistence beats perfection.**
